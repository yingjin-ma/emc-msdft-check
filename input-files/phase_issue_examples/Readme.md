# The reference 

## H2 (2e2o with DZ basis)

To be added 

## H4 

### 

###

## LiH 

## NH3 (irregular structure)

(2e,3o)+4cls, ANO-S-MB basis;

The phase for orbitals-LAG is   wrong (although it can be easily fixed)
The phase for      MPS-LAG is correct 

## The dioxetonane

### 17cls+4e4o+ANO-RCC-pVDZ/DKH2

This is the example we used in the STC meeting, need about 10mins to obtain the results
